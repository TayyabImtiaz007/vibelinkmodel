▪ For instance, in the United States private business
investments in IT increased from less than 100 billion
dollars in 1980 to more than 500 billion dollars in 2010
▪ Moreover, the proportion of IT investments in total capital
investments grew from 32% in 1980 to 52% in 2010
▪ Over the decade from 2007 to 2017 average IT budgets
as a percentage of revenue increased almost by 75%,
from 3.50% of revenue in 2007 to 6.08% of revenue in
2017

IT Systems Are Becoming More Powerful
▪ Over the time, information systems become more
powerful, ubiquitous, diverse and affordable
▪ The computing power and storage capacity of IT
systems are increasing exponentially
▪ Business applications now can be deployed on
dedicated servers, hosted in the cloud, run in web
browsers and even installed on handheld mobile devices
▪ Packaged systems available today include various ERP,
CRM, SCM, BI, ECM, KM and other offerings
▪ The relative price of information systems is gradually
decreasing making different IT systems more accessible

The Use of IT Systems in Organizations
▪ The productive use of information systems for improving
the quality of business processes in organizations is not
equivalent merely to installing the appropriate software
and hardware
▪ Instead, the productive use of information systems
always requires consistent and coordinated changes in
three broad organizational aspects:
• People
• Processes
• Technology

People, Processes and Technology
▪ People aspect:
• Providing the necessary education and training to system users
• Explaining benefits of the new system, coping with resistance
• Dealing with political, cultural and power redistribution issues
▪ Processes aspect:
• Introducing new business processes enabled by the system
• Modifying existing business processes affected by the system
• Modifying relevant decision-making procedures and rules
▪ Technology aspect:
• Setting up the new IT system and required infrastructure
• Making the new system available to its end users
• Providing technical and help desk support to end users

Business Benefits of IT Systems
▪ The proper use of information systems can deliver
numerous business benefits and open multiple
innovative opportunities to organizations:
• Improve or automate business processes
• Reduce costs and delays
• Enable analytical capabilities
• Support executive decision-making
• Enable information sharing with partners, e.g.
in supply chains
• Facilitate effective knowledge exchange between employees
• Provide new customer communication channels
• Create new innovative products and services
• Develop entirely new business models

IT Systems and Competitive Advantage
▪ Information systems can help organizations execute their
business strategies and gain strategic competitive
advantage:
• Operational excellence and cost leadership – IT systems can be
used to automate operations, eliminate delays and deviations,
avoid manual labor and achieve predictable business processes
• Product differentiation and leadership – IT systems can be used
to facilitate the design of new products, support teamwork and
creativity or provide unique innovative products and services
• Customer intimacy and focus – IT systems can be used to collect
and store customer data, analyze customer preferences, target
specific customer groups and develop highly customized offers

Disruptive Technologies
▪ The dynamic technological environment also poses
significant threats to many organizations
▪ So-called disruptive technologies have the potential to
make entire industries irrelevant and reshape the global
competitive landscape:
• Yesterday the publishing industry had been disrupted by
electronic books (e-books), while the recording industry had
been disrupted by the Internet-based delivery of audio files
• Today the propagation of mobile devices, big data, Facebook,
YouTube and other social media disrupts many industries
• Tomorrow the Internet of things, industrial 3D printing, artificial
intelligence, blockchain-based technologies, electric and
driverless cars will disrupt many conventional industries

IT Systems and Compliance
▪ The proper use of information systems in organizations
became a subject of strict regulatory control
▪ National governments enacted legislative compliance
acts intended to regulate access, sharing and protection
of sensitive information stored in corporate IT systems,
e.g.
SOX in the USA and GDPR in the European Union
▪ Organizations are liable for incompliance with various
data protection acts established in their jurisdictions
▪ Therefore, information systems provide numerous
benefits, opportunities, threats and obligations to
organizations and their management is now a direct
responsibility of business executives

Organizations as Socio-Technical Systems
▪ Many or even most organizations today essentially
experience the convergence of business and IT
▪ Business capabilities of a modern organization are often
determined largely by the capabilities of its IT systems
▪ Modern organizations represent complex socio-
technical systems consisting of diverse but interacting
human actors, business processes and IT systems
▪ Business activities and IT landscapes enabling these
activities represent “two sides of the same coin”

Organizations as Evolving Systems
▪ Modern organizations represent decentralized, dynamic
and constantly evolving socio-technical systems
▪ Decision-making processes are distributed across
multiple global and local decision-makers
▪ Organizations are self-evolving entities, where actors
belonging to the organizational system gradually modify
this system by their daily decisions and actions
▪ Organizations always evolve organically, rather than
mechanically

Business and IT People in Organizations
▪ Business managers and IT specialists in organizations
are partners with significantly different duties
▪ Business managers represent a “frontend” responsible
for analyzing the external business environment and
determining the direction for evolving the organization
▪ IT specialists represent a “backend” responsible for
modifying the IT landscape to enable the evolution of the
organization towards the direction defined by business
▪ Put it simply, business decides what needs to be done,
while IT responds to these decisions

Consequences for Planning
▪ The nature of modern organizations has two critical
implications from the perspective of their planning
▪ Firstly, all the ongoing changes in business and IT parts
of an organization should be synchronized
▪ Secondly, organizations should be planned based on the
balance of global and local interests
▪ Therefore, organizations should align both short-term
and long-term changes in their IT landscapes to their
business plans, strategies and goals
▪ In other words, organizations should strive for so-called
business and IT alignment

The Notion of Business and IT Alignment
▪ The effective use of IT in organizations requires
achieving business and IT alignment
▪ Business and IT alignment implies that the IT goals,
plans and systems in an organization are consistent with
its business goals, plans and processes
▪ Business and IT alignment increases the payoff from IT
